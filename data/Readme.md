# Data folders

This contains the products produced by each iteration of the analysis. In particular, 
they are stored into subfolders having the name assigned by the attribute `batch` of 
the `Settings` class. 

Then, inside each subfolder, there will be the set of data files (together with the final
tables.txt file) and a folder called `figures` storing every figure produced by the 
analysis.
