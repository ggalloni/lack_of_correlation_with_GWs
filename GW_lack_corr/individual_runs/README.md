# Individual runs of GW_lack_corr

This folder contains the individual runs of the analysis on the lack-of-correlation
anomaly using Gravitational Waves (GWs). In particular, it contains the scripts to
produce $\ell_{\rm max} = 4,6,10$ analyses. Thus, you can run them individually instead
of running the `complete_pipeline.py` script.
